# ansible-playbooks



These playbooks are to help automate tasks I do on a regular basis with my virtual servers.

  This playbook runs the apt update/apt upgrade -y/apt autoremove/apt autoclean commands for all your Linux hosts.
  
 Update_Plex:
  This playbook grabs the latest version of Plex from their website and installs the .deb package.
